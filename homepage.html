                In my role as a Desktop Support professional, I have provided comprehensive support for various operating systems, including Windows 10, Windows 11, and Mac OS.
                I have supported the Office Suite within O365, handling user onboarding and offboarding tasks.

                As a Software QA Analyst, I have ensured good test coverage across products, taking the lead in resolving production bugs by working closely with developers.
                I possess a strong understanding of database tables and have expertise in writing queries to test reports and identify bugs.

                Moreover, I have gained valuable experience in testing APIs, conducting black box testing, and performing Salesforce and web application testing.
                I have excelled in resolving syncing issues between systems by understanding triggers and detecting data discrepancies.
                Additionally, I have utilized various tools such as Adobe XD, Excel, Jira, and TestRail to develop and document test cases.
